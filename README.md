Development of a car price prediction model, covering key steps from data collection to model optimization and deployment. Our goal is to create an accurate and reliable tool to help car buyers and sellers make informed decisions.
STEPS : 
 1) Importing a Preprocessed Dataset of a similar company (Quikr) through Kaggle.
 2) Cleaning Data
 3) Checking Relationships of Price with different parameters (Comapany , year , fuel type etc)
 4) Plotting Maps on the basis of these relationships .
 5) Applying Train test Split.
 6) Linear Regression Model
 7) Making a Pipeline.
 8) Fitting the model.

 The Python notebook for the project has been mentioned in the Code section.

PowerBI dasboard created with reference to the Python file.
